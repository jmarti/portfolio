description: "Hello! My name is Jordi Martí. I’m from Barcelona, but now I’m based on Medellín, Colombia. I’m working leading front-end developer teams. I’m always thinking on how my workflows can be improved. Often, I’m looking for new places to travel with my Volkswagen van. I also spend my free time doing some carpentry, and I’d love to learn how to work with leather as well."
